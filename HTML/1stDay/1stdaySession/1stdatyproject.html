    <h1 style="color:black">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
    <p>
       <b> As I sit here with one foot on either side of the ledge,</b> looking down
        from twelve stories above the streets of Boston, I can’t help but think
        about suicide.
    
    <p>
        Not my <em>own</em>. I like my life enough to want to see it through.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m more focused on other people, and how they ultimately come
        to the decision to just end their own lives. <i>Do they ever regret it?</i> <br>In the
        moment after letting go and the second before they make impact,
        there has to be a little bit of remorse in that brief free fall. Do they
        look at the ground as it rushes toward them and think, <i>“Well, crap.<br>
            This was a bad idea.”</i>
    </p>
    <small> Somehow, I think not.</small>
    I think about death a lot. Particularly today, considering I just—
    twelve hours earlier—gave one of the most epic eulogies the people
    of Plethora, Maine, have ever witnessed. Okay, maybe it wasn’t the
    most epic. It very well could be considered the most disastrous. I guess
    that would depend on whether you were asking my mother or me. <em>My
        mother, who probably won’t speak to me for a solid year after today.</em>
        <p>
            Don’t get me wrong; the eulogy I delivered wasn’t profound
 enough to make history, like the one Brooke Shields delivered at 
 Michael Jackson’s funeral. Or the one delivered by Steve Jobs’s sister.
 Or Pat Tillman’s brother. But it was epic in its own way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was nervous at first. It was the funeral of the prodigious Andrew
            Bloom, after all. Adored mayor of my hometown of Plethora, Maine.
            Owner of the most successful real-estate agency within city limits.
            Husband of the highly adored Jenny Bloom, the most revered
            teaching assistant in all of Plethora. And father of Lily Bloom—that
            strange girl with the erratic red hair who once fell in love with a
            homeless guy and brought great shame upon her entire family.
        </p>
        <big>
            That would be me. I’m Lily Bloom, and Andrew was my father.</big>
            <p>
                As soon as I finished delivering his eulogy today, I caught a flight
 straight back to Boston and hijacked the first roof I could find. <em>Again,
    not because I’m suicidal.</em> I have no plans to scale off this roof. I just
 really needed fresh air and silence, and dammit if I can’t get that
 from my third floor apartment with absolutely no rooftop access and
 a roommate who likes to hear herself sing.
            </p><pre></pre>
            <p> I didn’t account for how cold it would be up here, though. It’s not
                unbearable, but it’s not comfortable, either. At least I can see the
                stars. Dead fathers and exasperating roommates and questionable
                eulogies don’t feel so awful when the night sky is clear enough to
                literally feel the grandeur of the universe.</p>
                <pre> I love it when the sky makes me feel insignificant</pre>
                I like tonight.<br>
                Well . . . let me rephrase this so that it more appropriately reflects
                my feelings in past tense.
                <p>
                    I<i> liked </i>tonight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    eep breaths and forces them back out when he’s done with them.
 He appears to be on the verge of a breakdown. I contemplate
 speaking up to let him know he has company, or clearing my throat,
 but between thinking it and actually doing it, he spins around and
 kicks one of the patio chairs behind him. I flinch as it screeches across the deck, but being as though he isn’t
    even aware he has an audience, the guy doesn’t stop with just one
    kick. He kicks the chair repeatedly, over and over. Rather than give
    way beneath the blunt force of his foot, all the chair does is scoot
    farther and farther away from him.
                </p>
                <i>
                    That chair must be made from marine-grade polymer.
