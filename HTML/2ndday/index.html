            <mark> “Lily,” I finally say. I hate my voice. It sounds too weak to even reach
                his ears from here, much less reverberate inside his body.</mark> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he’s not in private. He just doesn’t know that yet.
            He takes in a long drag of his joint and starts to turn back toward
            the ledge. He notices me on the exhale. He stops walking the second
            our eyes meet. His expression holds no shock, nor does it hold
            amusement when he sees me. He’s about ten feet away, but there’s
            enough light from the stars that I can see his eyes as they slowly drag
            over my body without revealing a single thought. This guy holds his
            cards well. His gaze is narrow and his mouth is drawn tight, like a
            male version of the Mona Lisa.

        I stare at the guy a moment longer, wondering if he’s ever going to
        move. He’s just standing there, staring down at the chair. His hands
        aren’t in fists anymore. They’re resting on his hips, and I notice for
        the first time how his shirt doesn’t fit him very well around his biceps.
        It fits him everywhere else, but his arms are huge. He begins fishing
        around in his pockets until he finds what he’s looking for and—in
        what I’m sure is probably an effort to release even more of his
        aggression—he lights up a joint.

        He turns a little, like he can’t look straight at me. “Please get
        down.” It’s more of a demand now, despite his use of the word please.
        “There are seven empty chairs up here.

    This guy is beautiful. Well-manicured, smells like money, looks to be
    several years older than me. His eyes crinkle in the corners as they
    follow me, and his lips seem to frown, even when they aren’t. When I
    reach the side of the building that overlooks the street, I lean forward
    and stare down at the cars below, trying not to appear impressed by
    him. I can tell by his haircut alone that he’s the kind of man people
    are easily impressed by, and I refuse to feed into his ego. Not that he’s
    done anything to make me think he even has one. But he is wearing a
    casual Burberry shirt, and I’m not sure I’ve ever been on the radar of
    someone who could casually afford one.
